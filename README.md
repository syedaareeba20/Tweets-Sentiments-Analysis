**# Sentiment Analysis using LSTM**

## Project Description

This project implements an LSTM model to classify text as "positive," "negative," or "neutral" based on sentiment analysis. The text data, provided in a CSV file with multiple columns, is preprocessed using tokenization, padding, and embedding. The trained model is then applied to the 01tweet dataset to identify sentiment in the 01tweet data.

## Tasks

### 1. Implement an LSTM Model

- **Objective**: Classify text as either "positive," "negative," or "neutral."
- **Dataset**: A CSV file containing multiple columns.
- **Steps**:
  - Preprocess the text data using tokenization, padding, and embedding.
  - Train an LSTM model to predict the sentiment label.

### 2. Apply Trained Model on 01tweet Dataset

- **Objective**: Identify the sentiment of 01tweet data using the trained model.
