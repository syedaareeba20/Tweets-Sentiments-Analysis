# Tweets-Sentiments-Analysis
This project implements an LSTM model to classify text as "positive," "negative," or "neutral" based on sentiment analysis. The text data, provided in a CSV file with multiple columns, is preprocessed using tokenization, padding, and embedding. The trained model is then applied to the 01tweet dataset to identify sentiment in the 01tweet data.
